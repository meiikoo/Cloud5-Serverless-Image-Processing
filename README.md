# Cloud5-Serverless-Image-Processing
CS1660 Final Project

## My Contribution — Hao Wang

I was the primary contributor to this project (25 of 44 commits).

- **AI image-generation module** — implemented `generate_image(prompt)`, a
  wrapper around the OpenAI Images API returning image bytes plus structured
  metadata (model, latency, request_id, seed). Handles retryable errors
  (429/500/502/503/504) with exponential backoff (1.5s ×2, max 3 attempts) and
  parses both base64 and URL response formats.
- **HTTP entrypoint + CLI** — added the Lambda HTTP handler and a Rust CLI
  (`clap` + `reqwest`) that calls the backend without exposing the OpenAI key.
- **CI/CD** — authored and debugged the GitHub Actions workflow: push → Docker
  build → push to ECR, image tagged with the commit SHA.
- **Integration & docs** — took part in integration testing and fixed
  JSON-formatted secret parsing from AWS Secrets Manager; wrote the README
  setup documentation and recorded my presentation segment.

*Note: AWS infrastructure setup, manual deployments, and final video assembly
were shared with teammates.*

## Project Description

### Serverless Image Processing Service
Develop a web application that allows users to upload and process images.
• Suggested AWS Services: S3, Lambda, IAM, SNS, ECR, CloudWatch, Secrets Manager
• Users upload images to S3
• AI image service processes images
• Provide downloadable URLs for processed images
• Track processing history per user

## Event-Driven Flow

1. User uploads a JSON prompt to `s3://<bucket>/prompt/`.
2. S3 event triggers SNS topic; SNS routes to `generate-image-lambda`.
3. Lambda parses the prompt, calls the AI image-generation API, stores the resulting image in `processed/ai/`, and logs prompt metadata.
4. Downstream services download the generated image and metadata from S3.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Secrets and IAM Foundation**
   - Store API keys in Secrets Manager (or encrypted environment variables).
   - Update IAM roles/policies so the Lambda can read secrets, write to S3, and publish logs.

2. **Implement AI Image Generation**
   - Build a small module or helper that calls the chosen AI API and returns image bytes or base64.
   - Handle retries, rate limits, and response validation; encapsulate error handling.

3. **Lambda Logic Update**
   - Replace Pillow code with prompt parsing plus AI API invocation logic.
   - Persist generated images and metadata in `processed/ai/`.

4. **Container Packaging and Dependencies**
   - Update the Dockerfile, bundle SDK dependencies, and ensure compatibility with Lambda’s runtime.
   - Rebuild the container image, push it to ECR, and confirm the Lambda picks up new layers.

5. **Event Routing and Permissions**
   - Reconfigure S3 notifications to publish prompt uploads to SNS.
   - Subscribe the new Lambda with the proper filter policy and grant SNS invoke permissions.

6. **Validation and Monitoring**
   - Run the end-to-end test script (e.g., `hack/test-ai.sh`) and manual prompt uploads.
   - Set up log/metric dashboards to watch success rates, latency, and API quota usage.

## Work Allocation (5 Members)

- **M1** — Step 1: Secrets & IAM setup. Short, foundational prep work.
- **M2** — Step 2: Implement the AI image-generation helper module.
- **M3** — Step 3: Refactor the Lambda handler to use the new AI module.
- **M4** — Step 4: Update the container/Dockerfile, manage dependencies, push to ECR.
- **M5** — Steps 5–6: Rewire S3/SNS permissions and own validation/monitoring rollout.

## Setup & Run
- Prereqs: AWS us-east-1, S3 bucket (e.g., `cloud5-serverless-image-processing`), SNS topic to trigger the Lambda, ECR repo, Secrets Manager secret `cloud5/openai/api-key` (value = raw `sk-...` or `{"api_key":"sk-..."}`), Lambda env: `OPENAI_API_SECRET_NAME=cloud5/openai/api-key`, `AWS_REGION=us-east-1`.
- Deploy: set GitHub secrets `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` / `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`; ensure `ECR_REPO` and `FUNCTION_NAME` in `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` match your ECR repo and Lambda; run the workflow (push to main or dispatch) to build/push image and update Lambda.
- Lambda handler: `handler.main_handler` handles SNS/S3 (event) and HTTP (Function URL/API Gateway). Role needs `secretsmanager:GetSecretValue`, S3 read/write, CloudWatch Logs.
- HTTP test: POST `{"prompt":"..."}` to the Function URL; expect JSON with `image_base64`. CLI: `API_URL=<function-url> cargo run -- "your prompt"` → outputs `out.png`.
- Local helper smoke test: set `OPENAI_API_KEY`, run the snippet in `M2_AI_Helper.md` to generate `out.png`.
- CloudWatch: logs in `/aws/lambda/<function>`; add metric filters/alarms for Errors/Duration/Throttles as needed.
